# People Paladin

Pillars of the ecosystem Helium for People.

## Introduction

The project Helium for People is intended to create a complex ecosystem based on an accurate management of mining gateways. This system will be concrete and remunerative, for all the users of the community, through the careful management of value reserves arising from the deposit of mined HNT. 
The first step is the purchase of a number x of hotspots that will represent a very important part to carry out the project. 
For experienced users, we propose the program People Paladin. It allows, for users that will be interested, to purchase a part of the mining of these first hotspots, pillars of the ecosystem.
The purchase of portions of the mining reward is carried out through timed campaigns: the user can buy a hexagon of the grid to which is related the percentage of mining that the new user will obtain. 

### Grid of Hexagons
The grid of hexagons represents the blocks that will gradually light up thanks to advanced users. The home page of the website Helium for People displays the grid of hexagons for the full length of time of the campaign ‘People Paladin’. 
The grid is composed of 2000 hexagons. Users can select a hexagon that will light up at the end of the purchase (if not registered, users must register before proceeding with the purchase). At each block that lights up, the relative percentage and estimate of its mining will appear at the top of the grid. Estimates are based on the current state of the blockchain and the Helium for People ecosystem, meant and studied to guarantee the growth of reward estimates.
The payment of hexagons on the website can only be made in HNT for the benefit of the Helium network, especially during this first step.

### People Paladin Reward
The distribution of rewards of purchased hotspots during the People Paladin campaign will be divided according to the following percentages:
1.	50% - to users of the People Paladin program
2.	25% - for the regular purchase of hotspots for Helium for People (once reached X number of hotspots that can sustain the Helium for People system this percentage will be redistributed: 15% to the People Paladin program and 10% to the company Helium for People or other projects)
3.	20% retained by the company Helium for People to cover costs and guarantee the whole various possibilities of development
4.	5% - as value reserve for the EFS Token
5.	In addition to these percentages, users with the title of People Paladin will receive 3% of the mining of all the hotspots subsequently purchased and positioned by Helium for People.

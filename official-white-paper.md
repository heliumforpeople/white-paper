**Helium for People**

***Powering the People Network***

EFSociety
version 1.1 of 23/12/2021 (1.0-23 / 08/2020)

**Abstract**

Helium for people was born with the aim of helping the Helium network to grow, to develop in the correct and optimal way for the performance of all the figures within this ecosystem.

With the birth of Helium and its network we have been able to witness an explosive growth, both in terms of technology and in terms of the evaluation of the token itself, the HNTs (Helium Network Tokens).

Although this blockchain has shown reliability and constancy for the well-being of the entire network, there are flaws that are emerging, which, in addition to worrying the existing Helium community, make the decision for a new user to join more difficult. of this fantastic project.

The EFSociety with its Helium for People platform and its H4P token aims to become the driving force for profitable and optimal explosive growth for the entire Helium network.

But what are the problems encountered by the Helium community?

**Lack of data transfer**

One of the first biggest problems encountered is the scarce use of the Helium blockchain for sending data via IoT probes, in fact most of the hotspots in the world have never transmitted data except on rare occasions.

Having said that, it is necessary to remind users that Helium is not some sort of mine, from which to profit and that's it. Currently a large reward is given to those who provide coverage and witness, but it is so because at this moment the blockchain rewards those who provide coverage to the network.
In the future, the rewards due to the coverage and the witness provided will drop more and more until they become negligible because once the coverage has been created, the blockchian needs to be used for its purpose, or mining is no longer profitable for anyone.

Helium for People takes over to fill this first gap, the lack of use of the blockchain for sending data is due to the limited presence of projects that exploit Hotspots, not to undermine but to transfer data. This because?
Why In a world like that of start-ups this scenario usually occurs: start-up X has a vision; a group of people pool their skills, resources and expertise and with great willpower launch the presentation and seek funds to carry on the developments.
At this point there must be people willing to make their capital available for future profit. Investors are generally not willing to be very patient, in fact, there are two parameters by which investments are evaluated: duration and profit.

That is, how long does it take for an investment to create a certain profit? These are parameters that do not coincide with those of the developers, who, to work well, need time and resources.
But in addition to Investors, what is the other figure present in this scenario, who can have the power to change this system?
The Miners, those who are really part of the network. Helium for People aims to bring together the forces of these figures in an ecosystem that has as its main objectives, to feed the blockchain, to fund open-source developments and to make everyone protagonists in the same way with the ultimate aim of making the benefits concrete and tangible. economic and otherwise, of an ecosystem that aims to develop technology designed by the citizen and for the citizen.
By analyzing the data provided in the Helium Whitepaper (reported below) we can draw a positive conclusion:
"The Internet of Things is an $ 800 billion industry, with over 8.4 billion connected devices online, and spending predicted to reach nearly $ 1.4 trillion by 2021. Most of these devices need to connect to the Internet to function. However, current solutions such as cellular , WiFi, and Bluetooth are suboptimal: they are too expensive, too power hungry, or too limited in range. The Helium network is a decentralized wireless network that enables devices anywhere in the world to wirelessly connect to the Internet and geolocate themselves without the need for power-hungry satellite location hardware or expensive cellular plans ".
The market generated by IoT technology is a thriving market and destined to grow exponentially.
Each company in the sector has a development department to which it dedicates funds and resources. Each development department of each company works independently and in most cases without sharing the progress made with other companies.
This generates, yes, a healthy competition that pushes companies to invest more and more to gain advantage over other competitors, but on the other hand it limits the development that this technology could have in the short and long term. Just think about what progress could be, however, if at least in part these funds were destined for mutual funds for development and in what time frame these results could be achieved.

**Uneven coverage**

Another problem encountered is the lack of uniformity of the coverage, which in turn generates various problems.

Uneven coverage is given by the fact that many miners are concentrated in large cities while those located in rural areas will probably never have other hotspots nearby, so unless they want to invest thousands and thousands of euros in devices, mining does not will never be profitable.
A large proportion of people interested in the project unfortunately find themselves in this situation and are discouraged from providing coverage.

Another limitation given by non-homogeneous coverage is inefficient mining, in fact Hotspots that are incorrectly arranged provide less rewards from the mined block.

Last but not least, having uneven coverage certainly does not incentivize large companies to invest and develop projects on this blockchain, because they would develop a service for a small portion of the global population which is the one covered by the Helium network.

**Entrance barrier**

Unfortunately, the barrier to entry to start undermining and becoming part of this network is not within everyone's reach. In fact, if we analyze what Helium makes available to actively start mining HNT, only two things can be done:
1- Buy a hotspot
2- Become a Validators and stake 10000 HNT
Let's analyze the first option, to buy a hotspot a user has two possibilities, contact a manufacturer directly with a cost ranging from 700 to 900 euros and waiting times ranging from 8 to 20 weeks or buy one from a scalper with prices that they range from 1200 to 1800 euros.
If we think that not everyone lives in an area with other hotspots and if we think about the shipping times in relation to the cost, certainly many users will not be incentivized to grow the network.

While the second option is certainly not for everyone, with an average value of € 20 for HNT we are talking about € 200,000.00 to start stacking.

**Conclusions**

Helium is a great project with a single mission, focused on the fair division of mining and the fair remuneration of all members of the network.

At H4P, our mission is to accelerate the growth of the network, its use, by organizing users in a solid collaboration network that is equally remunerative for all. The H4P network will act as a flywheel on the Helium network and as a lever for the rewards of users who are part of the ecosystem.

By breaking down the barriers to entry, structuring a network of functional devices for both coverage and mining and through a governance system, it allows users to decide which projects using IoT technology and the Helium blockchain should be financed.

**Introduction**

The H4P Project undertakes to develop, based on the data traffic present in the blockchian Helium and the related mining, an ecosystem that favors the development of technology, the value of the blockchian itself and the remuneration for citizens who are part of the network directly and not. .

The platform offers the opportunity to join the network even simply by installing a hotspot on loan for use in your home without any investment and start mining, but H4P is not a simple Hosting company, it is much more.
Users will be able to purchase NFTs which represent a mining portion of our hotspots or simply stack our token and mine. (All features are explained in detail below.)
The HNT (Helium Network Token) mined by all the devices of our platform have the function of reserve of value for the Token of the H4P platform and its relative token.

The H4P token has the function of creating liquidity on the platform, reducing transaction costs,

simplify the divisions of mining rewards, create a governance system, and generate a leverage effect on the value of HNTs and for HNTs by reducing the amount of tokens in motion.
In the future it will be used as a token for the purchase of all IoT devices financed by the platform and chosen with the governance system by users.

**HNT**

Helium Network Tokens are used by Helium Network both to reward users for services rendered and as a currency for data acquisition by the IoT devices that use it.
Whenever an IoT device sends or receives data it consumes Data Credits. The DCs can be purchased by credit card or through the conversion of HNT, which are burned after each purchase in such a way as to increase the value of the Helium Network Tokens.
Conversely, a user who has a gateway, used to transfer this data, is rewarded in Helium Network Token.

**H4P**

What are H4Ps? H4P Tokens are the tool to make a decisive contribution to the Helium network. The H4P tokens are a real cryptocurrency created on the Cardano blockchain, in fact one of the most ambitious objectives of the Helium 4 People project with its H4P token is to create a bridge between the Helium blockchain and the Cardano one in order to make the network more liquid. , profitable and expendable for all users.

The choice to use the cardano blockchain as a support for our token and therefore also for the entire Helium community, is not only technical but also philosophical. In fact, for all those who do not know the project, we invite you to read something on their official page https://iohk.io/ to understand more about the potential of this blockchain than the others and what philosophy accompanies it. One of the objectives from this point of view, in fact, will be to obtain the IOHK security certification as developed on the Cardano blockchain. This is because it would certify the reliability of the project and of the Team, which made it possible, to the entire blockchain ecosystem. We invite all users to read the reference article directly on the IOHK website at the following link: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/22/bringing-certified-dapps-to-cardano/.
But to understand even better, we also recommend watching the following video, where CEO IOHK exposes to the public what is the philosophy of the Cardano blockchain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsx2yuoHLSQ.
Having said this, let's go into a little more detail, how are H4P tokens created? The H4Ps are created with the equivalent of the HNTs, i.e. every time the mining reward of a block, perceived by a Hotspot placed by the platform, arrives on the H4P wallet, our platform acts as a bridge for the blockchain card where the algorithm of Helium 4 People mines H4P tokens at a ratio of 1: 10000.
To give a very simple example, it is as if the HNTs were the gold in the coffers of the banks and the H4Ps the banknotes printed with a precise ratio to give more liquidity and stimulate the growth of the economy.
If we then add that the reserve that is used as a value grows in relation to the mining rewards of the Hotspots of the H4p platform, in a constant or variable way, we can generate a internal product, which, if applied to a fair and well-distributed ecosystem, can generate resources for all the figures in the ecosystem.

The H4P tokens will have different functions, the main ones being: giving the possibility to manage decisions on the platform, on the user side, with a governance system, breaking down the entry barriers to the Helium network and applying financial leverage to the ecosystem to make it more liquid and expendable for the public. But now let's go into more detail:


1 - receive the rewards of Stacking, Mining, Hosting and of LaunchPad.

2 - vote on the projects proposed on the platform and every decision of the community through the governance system.

3 - Increase the value of HNTs by implementing a deflationary mechanism on the circulating supply, blocking as many as possible to the benefit of both HNT and H4P ecosystems.

4 - Making Helium Network closer to the narratives of the current market and joining it to a blockchain as valid as that of Cardano.

5 - be used as a payment currency within the H4P platform to reduce the costs of fees and transform them at least in part into profits to be conveyed to the community.

6 - to be able to create a launch pad dedicated to projects based on IoT technology that want to involve the Helium and Cardano communities.

All the functions of the H4P token and user rewards are explained in detail in the token economics section.

the choice was made to create a token dedicated to the H4P platform, so as not to affect the value of the HNTs to support the entire H4P ecosystem. This applied to a token economics studied in detail will favor the appreciation of the value of the HNTs, at the same time that of the H4Ps and in the long term will generate a leverage effect on both HNT and H4P.

**Helium 4 People platform**

As we know, the Helium gateways act as a node for the exchange of data in the internet for the IoT devices covered by their LoWra network and are rewarded with tokens for this service provided, but it is not so simple, in fact many hotspots have negligible rewards. either because they are too close to other hotspots and therefore compete or because they are too far away and therefore no devices are not communicating.

Taking into account what has just been said, the whole network needs to find a way to correctly distribute the gateways on the territory and at the same time a way to include everyone in this network and not just those who can own a Hotspot or stack 10,000 HNTs.
In fact, inevitably, given how the Helium ecosystem is now constituted, if you want to expand it in the correct and profitable way for everyone, many people would be excluded or limited in mining. While for stacking to become blockchain Validator, that is 10,000 HNT with a delay of 6 months, it is really prohibitive for most of the small investors or technology enthusiasts.

Beyond this is added the need to exploit the blockchain for data transfer, so that it remains thriving and profitable for miners in the long term, therefore there is also a strong need to incentivize the development of applications that use IoT technology on the Helium blockchain through a dedicated launchpad.

The H4P platform will be a connection point between all the figures involved in the world of technology

IoT on the Helium blockchain without excluding anyone from the network and making it more liquid and profitable.
The main figures within the H4P platform will be:

1 - Paladin

2 - Citizen

3 - Stacker(Merchant)

Each of these 3 figures is a crucial part of the ecosystem, so it is our intention to create a network that does not exclude anyone and rewards them all in the correct way over time.

***Paladin user***
A Paladin user is a user who has purchased an NFTs which represents a portion of the mining of our Hotspots.

***Citizen user***
The Citizen user has received one of our hotspots on loan for use and then receives a portion of the mining rewards for the service provided.

***Stackers(merchant) user***
Users who do not want to rent a portion of the mining and do not want to have a hotspot in their home can contribute to the platform by purchasing the tokens and placing them in stacking, in the liquidity pool, thus becoming staker and also receiving a large portion of the mining rewards. .

**Rent portion of Mining and Paladin program**

Why Paladin? Because they will be the pillars for the creation of the H4P network and its expansion. The Paladins will be the defenders of our Network.
To become a Paladin, a User must rent the mining portion of a Hotspot of the H4P platform for life.
So why not just mine with our Hotspots and take the profits home? Why mining our gateways? It's easy our team has a long-term vision and we believe in the crucial role that IoT technology will play in the future and therefore in the value that the Helium blockchian can achieve in 4, 8 or 12 years. Precisely because we believe in this technology and in the value of this blockchain that we have the ambitious goal of building the largest network of devices in the world, to do this we need your help to grow. So we decided to finance ourselves by tokenizing through the support of NFTs technology portions of the mining of our hotspots and with the money collected to finance new devices and thus start an endless chain, destined to grow exponentially, both for the number of devices and for the rewards of the users.
Having said that, how do they actually become Paladin? Users registered on the H4P platform have the opportunity to purchase even a single NFTs mining reward slot of one of our hotspots for the paltry amount of € 15, 100 NFTs slots at a cost of € 9 per slot for a total of € 900 and 1000 NFTs slots € 8 l 'one for a total of € 8000.
Why should the user become an H4P Paladin and not buy a hotspot on his own and place it?

As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the barrier to entry is very high, but not only economically. Let's tackle the economic side first by purchasing a Hotspot directly from factory can have a cost that varies between 700 € and 1200 € with waiting times ranging from 8 weeks to 20, up to becoming infinite, while buying it from a retailer exposes to many scams and crazy price increases until you get a device to € 2000 if not more.
Instead, on the H4P platform, the user can decide how much to spend from the comfort of € 15, thus giving virtually everyone the opportunity to start mining. But more importantly, the user will not have to wait decades to see his first reward on the wallet because he is purchasing a portion of hotspot mining that the H4P platform has already placed and they are already actually mining HNT, so the first reward will arrive after 24 hours from the 'purchase.
This is not the only advantage of becoming a Paladin user on the H4P platform compared to buying and holding a single Hotspot, in fact the user will not have to think about anything starting from the setting of the device to the purchase of more performing antennas, wiring or any upgrade of no whatsoever. He will simply have to claim his portion of the mining and start receiving the mining rewards, H4P will take care of everything.
In the following paragraphs all the mining rewards will be explained in detail and how they will be divided among the various users of the platform.

**Loan for use and Citizen users**

Unlike Paladin users, Citizens will have no cost at the entrance, in fact, to obtain a hotspot on loan for use, you will not have to pay anything.
The user has two ways to access the Citizen program, enroll in the program by providing the location of the private property in his possession, where he can install our hotspot and take an educational course with a final test. The course and the final test is necessary for Citizen users because holding a hotspot on loan for use involves serious responsibilities from a technical and timing point of view, we want it to be a necessary requirement also to prevent resources from being wasted.
Once the necessary data has been provided and the test has been successfully passed, the user will be called as soon as our network needs to expand in the same area where the user's private property is located.
Another way to become a Citizen user is to be contacted and instructed by one of the H4P Agents who are in charge of expanding the network.

**Stackers users, H4P tokens and mining rewards**

Last but not least the Users who want to stack on the platform to mine, to overcome the problem that not everyone can be Citizen and not everyone will want to buy a portion of the mining thus becoming Paladin, we have implemented the possibility of stacking on the platform to perceive a portion of the mining rewards of our Hotspots. Unlike the investment to become Paladin which is a real purchase that awards you a portion of the mining for life, stacking, i.e. to the people who will delegate their tokens to the liquidity pool, to provide liquidity to the users of the platform, of course. it is not a purchase but a fixed deposit that will allow users who want to receive a portion of the mining of the H4P hotspots and when they deem it more appropriate they can remove their tokens from the stacking and stop receiving the mining rewards.
Obviously in proportion, the portion of mining reserved for stacking rewards is slightly lower than the rewards provided by the Paladin program, but in any case it allows everyone with a minimum investment to join the network, without crazy costs, endless waiting lists and no thoughts. when setting or placing a hotspot.

**Mining management HNT, H4P token, and Reserves of value**

To make our token economics and therefore our entire network sustainable, we need well distributed, balanced and functional reserves of value.These reserves of value are generated through the accumulation of HNT mined by Hotspots given on loan for use by the H4P platform to Citizen users and bound by precise rules.



**Hotspot mining reward division**

The mining reward of the hotspots of the H4P platform is divided as follows:

1 - 70% allocated to the store of value for H4P token to give the rewards to the users of the platform

2 - 30% allocated to the H4P company to cover management, development and marketing costs.

The 30% collected by the company is divided as follows and intended for the following uses: 50% cover the costs of managing web and non-web infrastructures and pay salaries to the team; 30% to cover the development costs of the platform and IoT projects on the Helium blockchain and pay developer salaries; 20% to the retailer marketing to grow the H4P netwotk.

The 70% allocated to the store of value for the H4P token is bound on a wallet to mine the H4P token in a ratio of 1: 10000

![Head](https://i.ibb.co/y40KXmw/My-First-Board-Frame-8.jpg)

to divide the rewards as follows: 

60% NFTs Paladin user program

10% rewards invitation program for NFTs Paladin users; 

10% Citizen user program; 

10% H4P stacking rewards on the liquidity pool in the platform; 

5% reward for users who will participate in the LaunchPad program (allocated in other rewards until the LaunchPad is not available), 

2% of the rewards are destined to be burned, 

3% H4P online platform.

![Head](https://i.ibb.co/cYzq2Yt/My-First-Board-Frame-9.jpg)

The division of the rewards of the mining of the hotspots is divided in this way to give more relevance to the program for Paladins, because in the initial launch phase of the platform, it is the Paladins who activate all the self-financing mechanism of the H4P platform, which allows you to buy more and more Helium hotspots to be attributed to the H4P platform program and thus to the entire Helium for People ecosystem that we have created on the Cardano blockchain.
The whole ecosystem is built and designed to maximize the yield for each user of the platform who becomes part of the H4P project without any barrier to entry, neither in terms of geographic location, distribution of coverage, initial investment and much more. 

**Mining Reward Validator Division**

Another important element for the performance of our entire ecosystem is the reward given by the creation of Validator on the Helium blockchain. In fact, as mentioned in the previous chapters, all the mined HNTs will be bound and kept aside as a reserve of value for the H4P Tokens, to optimize the yield of the entire ecosystem for all users, the H4P team has decided to create multiple Validators, based on the HNTs collected in the store of value AND use the rewards perceived by the Validators to convey them to the users of the Helium for People platform in H4P token.
The mining deriving from the Validators will be divided as follows:

1-15% H4P company

2-85% H4P value store

The created H4P reserve of value will be divided as follows:

20% Paladin user program

3% Paladin invitation rewards program

2% Citizen user program

5% Merchant user program

15% for users who will participate in the LaunchPad program

3% for Burn

5% H4P online platform.

and finally a part of the rewards will be destined to the incentive of the first slots sales sessions to become a Paladin user, 

H4P NFTs 1st sale 5%

H4P NFTs 2nd sale 5%

H4P NFTs 3rd sale 5%

H4P NFTs 4th sale 6%

H4P NFTs 5th sale 6%

H4P NFTs 6th sale 10%

H4P NFTs 7th sale 10%

A large part of these rewards will be destined for users who participate in the LaunchPad H4P used by all projects that exploit IoT technology and the Helium blockchain who want to expand their community to all users of the Cardano ecosystem.

This is because when the Validators are created, the H4P platform will be mature enough to be able to attract companies that want to offer themselves to our audience and users will be incentivized to use this new function of the platform to receive more rewards and to become part of new projects. based on IoT technology even before they hit the market.

**Liquidity pool and fee division**

Another source of rewards for users will be the liquidity pools, initially only one liquidity pool dedicated only to our token, then the liquidity pool of the projects listed in the launch pad.
The initial liquidity pool is H4P / ADA, users who provide liquidity to the pool will be identified as merchants and will receive additional rewards in addition to the normal fees from transactions that take place on the H4P / ADA pool.
The total rewards for each figure on the platform will be easily calculated by the calculator on the platform and by the graphs shown below in the white paper.
The rewards deriving from the liquidity pool will be divided as follows:

1 - Paladin NFTs slot 20%

2 - 3% Paladin invitation program

3 - Citizen 2%

4 - Merchant / liquidity provider 30%

5 - LaunchPad Stacking 5%

6 - Burn 5%

7 - H4P NFTs 1st sale 3%

8 - H4P NFTs 2nd sale 2%

9 - H4P NFTs 3rd sale 2%

10 - H4P NFTs 4th sale 2%

11 - H4P NFTs 5th sale 2%

12 - H4P NFTs 6th sale 2%

13 - H4P NFTs 7th sale 2%

14 - H4P Company 10%

15 - 10% unallocated
